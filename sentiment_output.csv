"I remember when Republicans used to cry about the ""nanny state"" banning people from smoking in public places and now they're the ones saying ""oh we need to check your ID before you download that messaging app"".",negative,0.999
I‚Äôm curious how they‚Äôre actually planning on enforcing this. The real solution is parenting.,negative,0.969
"Creating this law for child safety is a red herring.

The goal is to increase surveillance for all users of the service, not just minors. By requiring age verification, there will be collection of user personal data.",negative,0.999
I'm not sure I can think of a bigger Nanny State than Texas. Least personal freedom of any state.,negative,0.999
I'd love it if Google and Apple responded by pulling their app stores from anyone in Texas and refer all complaints to the Governor's office. It's about time to go on the offensive against this state instead of playing defense against the whims of these Republicans,negative,0.999
"I hope Apple and Google just stop participating in Texas. Fuck anybody that supports their bullshit. Greg Abbott and Ken Paxton are absolutely edgelord trolls, you‚Äôd have to be a real loser to cheer for any of it.",negative,0.998
"Its funny, because children have already figured out how to bypass this and were spreading it in games like Roblox.

What they do is take a picture of someone old and then just use that as the ID to receive access to adult content. They're using Youtubers faces since there is literally unlimited amounts of free faces online to use.

The AI can't tell the difference between a person standing there, and a photo as they're both real people on a screen.

All this grandstanding has done nothing but waste money and create a data list of 10 million Markipliers accessing porn all over the States from peoples computers.

Good job anti porn legislation.

Apple and Google should just cut TX off entirely.,negative,1.0
"Weren‚Äôt Republicans supposed to be the party of small government?

The party of hypocrisy. They absolutely hate freedom unless it's convenient for them. Texas is such an awful state.,negative,0.999
"The actual bill has messed up definitions‚Ä¶ technically, it defines App Store as any software, website, etc, that users can access to add software to a mobile device. Ultimately, this means that websites like github are an App Store. If a developer decided to email a customer an app, their email program would be an App Store?",negative,0.999
"Congrats! They‚Äôve made a requirement that won‚Äôt be able to be actually verified. I mean, they‚Äôve been trying for decades to outsmart kids online and every decade kids manage to figure out workarounds to EVERY age gate, verification, child lock, etc., that have been invented. What a complete waste of taxpayer money instead of trying to solve actual problems. Porn isn‚Äôt the great villain religious zealots and puritanical people make it out to be.",negative,0.999

Texans evidently cannot think for ourselves our nanny police state bought and paid for republicans think they have to do it for us. They are the absolute Christo Taliban.,negative,0.997

"I remember when they said they would eliminate Rape. In response to the abortion ban. 

They literally just in a press conference said they would stop all rape. No plan to do this or implement something. When asked if they would share this amazing idea so other states could implement this way to stop all rape. They had no comment. 

It‚Äôs amazing that they keep people in a bubble and they still get votes to stay in power.",positive,0.967

Ah Texas the One Star State.,negative,0.889
"I think that for a lot of teens social media has replaced the ""third place"" in society that is not either home or work/school. If you effectively take that away from them overnight I'd expect to see repercussions such as youth crime rates going up.",negative,0.996

Didn't see any details of what specifically they want Apple and Google to do to verify ages. Apple's current method on iPhone is to have the users input details from a credit card to prove they're over 18.,negative,0.998
"This is sort of inevitable if parents don't properly set time restrictions for their kids. The government wouldn't be able to push for more stricter regulations if it weren't a problem in the first place.¬†


The pros to regulating age is that you will hopefully have kids who's brains aren't rotted.


The cons are that the government gains yet even more power to control the people.",negative,0.98
"Today its social media,  can't have them reocording and posting any wrong doing from authority figures.  Next it'll be the whole internet,  can't have them accessing information that's not approved by the same authority",negative,0.996

"They're trying to claw back the culture war they lost, by making it harder and harder for LGBTQ kids to find each other and feel safe. It‚Äôs the same reason for the ‚Äúporn‚Äù bans which oops all seem to target the LGBTQ community.¬†",negative,0.992

Ban all Texans from the app stores and let the state enjoy the consequences of their actions.,negative,0.993
"How are these companies supposed to confirm that a parent consented to the kid having access? It makes zero sense. 

Clearly the goal of these bills are to suppress teens freedom of speech and access to knowledge, as well as their right to work.",negative,1.0

"I'll be interested to see the application of this. I'd imagine these aren't going to be the same age verifications that have already existed where you just put in your ""birthday"" right?

This shouldn‚Äôt be a left or right thing.  Social Media is toxic and accessing it should be for adults.  These platforms are screwing up our entire society.,negative,0.999
"This and the THC ban could really backfire. If Texas becomes a place that highlights where far right Christian nationalists politics is headed, then other states that are more moderate may favor the democrats in midterms.",negative,0.87
"Social media as a whole is literally designed to work against our own psychology, which is bad for adults let alone growing people.

If the sites weren‚Äôt led by sociopaths (hi, Steve/Mark/Elon among many more) they might be able to change but as they are they have no hope. Foreign platforms are literally incentivized to sow discontent. Then there is exploitation, which doesn‚Äôt seem to be acceptably moderated on platforms with a growing and endless stream of data to contain and filter.

The future can be better, but the now is scarier than it has ever been and with AI advances predatory users of AI will become evermore effective.

It‚Äôs kinda backwards but it‚Äôs likely beneficial for their growth and for their mental health. This should be discussed more, but folks are too consumed by it to talk about it frankly face to face and do something about it. Maybe this is the first move in that direction.",negative,0.999

"So exactly what do people hope to accomplish by banning teens from social media? Just seems arbitrary & very anti-freedom to me even for other countries to do it. While I think some content on social media needs to be limited based on age, an outright ban seems a tad extreme. Also I'm pretty sure teens make up a large number of the social media user base. They ban teens those social media platforms will probably lose a ton of users & traffic & the social media companies probably won't like that. This could also spark another teen revolution much like the rock & roll revolution in the 1950's where for the longest time adults kept trying to dictate musical trends & what teens & kids were allowed to listen to with a very similar mindset but eventually teens started to rebell & rise up & created their own music trend.",negative,0.999

"In China there's rampant resale of preverified video game accounts. Many foreigners buy account off them to play Chinese servers, as well as Chinese teens / some locals buy accounts off them. Same will happen in Texas and many people who get scammed / duped will instead get thrown under the bus, cause cybercriminals will cater to anyone uncomfortable with turning in their ID over using app store, selling preverified accounts and these fascists will think ones who got identity stolen have done it cause it's tied to them instead of ones using the account.",negative,0.998
100% impotent law. Kids are really smart when it comes to this stuff. This will drive kids to Android where they will just side load whatever apps they want to use or so called underground social media that can't be as easily monitored through a browser.,positive,0.93
"I am fine with this not happy since its an app store and you only have to verify ID once. But like the porn bill was stupid cause you have to upload your face or ID to every site now.

Its not like going into buy alcohol or tobacco where you show the ID then leave and their is no record.",negative,0.999
"Usually when things are brought in, their purpose is actually something different.

So, is this actually, a way to prove that you an adult, by providing ID and then they now have linked your social media to you directly?
